# crab-snake
This is a simple snake game written in rust. It was written quite gohorse, so
it is not a good implementation of the game. It is backed by SDL2

### known bugs
- you can change the snake direction more than once per frame, meaning you can
  do an 180 turn and die instantly if you're too fast
